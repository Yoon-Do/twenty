# Local Calendar Implementation Test Plan

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented the local calendar feature for Twenty CRM according to the specification. Here's what was implemented:

### Backend Changes:
1. **LocalCalendarEventWorkspaceEntity** - New separate entity for local events
   - Located: `packages/twenty-server/src/modules/calendar/common/standard-objects/local-calendar-event.workspace-entity.ts`
   - Fields: title, description, startsAt, endsAt, location, isFullDay, isCanceled
   - Relations: person, company, creator
   - Uses auto-generated GraphQL mutations (no custom resolvers needed)

2. **Standard Object IDs** - Added localCalendarEvent ID
   - Updated: `packages/twenty-server/src/engine/workspace-manager/workspace-sync-metadata/constants/standard-object-ids.ts`

3. **Core Object Names** - Added LocalCalendarEvent to enums
   - Updated: `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/object-metadata/types/CoreObjectNameSingular.ts`
   - Updated: `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/object-metadata/types/CoreObjectNamePlural.ts`

### Frontend Changes:
1. **useCreateNewLocalCalendarEvent** - Hook for creating local events
   - Located: `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/activities/calendar/hooks/useCreateNewLocalCalendarEvent.ts`
   - Leverages existing Twenty patterns (Command Menu, auto-generated mutations)

2. **LocalCalendarNewEventButton** - Create button component
   - Located: `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/activities/calendar/components/LocalCalendarNewEventButton.tsx`
   - Integrates with existing permission system

3. **useUnifiedCalendarEvents** - Merges local and external events
   - Located: `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/activities/calendar/hooks/useUnifiedCalendarEvents.ts`
   - Transforms local events to TimelineCalendarEvent format for seamless display

4. **Updated Calendar Component** - Shows create button and uses unified events
   - Modified: `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/activities/calendar/components/Calendar.tsx`
   - Added header with create button
   - Uses unified events hook

5. **Updated CalendarEventRow** - Supports edit/delete for local events
   - Modified: `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/activities/calendar/components/CalendarEventRow.tsx`
   - Shows edit/delete buttons on hover for local events
   - Differentiates local vs external events

## Key Features Implemented:

✅ **Separate Entity Approach** - Zero risk to existing calendar import system
✅ **Auto-generated GraphQL** - No custom mutations needed, leverages Twenty's system
✅ **Unified Display** - Local events appear seamlessly alongside external events
✅ **Command Menu Integration** - Create/edit uses existing Twenty patterns
✅ **Permission System** - Proper access control using existing Twenty permissions
✅ **Native UX** - Users can't tell the difference between local and external events
✅ **Edit/Delete Actions** - Local events have hover actions for modification
✅ **Relationship Support** - Events can be linked to Person or Company

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   make
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Person or Company page**

3. **Go to Calendar tab**

4. **Test Create Flow:**
   - Click "New Event" button (should appear in header and empty state)
   - Command Menu should open with event form
   - Fill in event details and save
   - Event should appear in calendar timeline

5. **Test Edit Flow:**
   - Hover over a local event
   - Click edit icon
   - Command Menu should open with existing data
   - Modify and save

6. **Test Delete Flow:**
   - Hover over a local event
   - Click delete icon
   - Confirm deletion
   - Event should disappear

7. **Test Integration:**
   - Verify local events appear alongside external calendar events
   - Verify sorting and display is consistent
   - Verify external events don't show edit/delete buttons

## Architecture Benefits:

- **Zero Risk**: Separate entity means no impact on existing calendar import
- **Leverages Existing System**: Uses Twenty's auto-generated GraphQL and UI patterns
- **Seamless UX**: Users see unified calendar experience
- **Easy Rollback**: Can be removed without affecting existing functionality
- **Future-Proof**: Can be merged with CalendarEvent entity later if needed

## Next Steps:

1. Test the implementation thoroughly
2. Add participants support (future enhancement)
3. Add recurring events (future enhancement)
4. Consider merging entities once stable (future enhancement)
