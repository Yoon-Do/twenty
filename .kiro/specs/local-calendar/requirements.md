# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Local Calendar feature in Twenty CRM. The feature will allow users to create, edit, and delete calendar events directly within the application without requiring external calendar integrations (Google/Microsoft Calendar). This provides users with a native calendar experience while maintaining the existing external calendar sync functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to create local calendar events directly in Twenty, so that I can schedule meetings and appointments without needing external calendar integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a Person or Company record THEN the system SHALL display a Calendar tab with existing functionality
2. WHEN a user clicks "Add Event" button in the Calendar tab THEN the system SHALL open a form to create a new local calendar event
3. WHEN a user fills out the event form with title, start time, end time THEN the system SHALL create a local calendar event
4. WHEN a user saves a local calendar event THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with proper relationships to Person/Company
5. WHEN a user views the Calendar tab THEN the system SHALL display both local and external calendar events seamlessly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to edit and delete local calendar events, so that I can manage my schedule effectively within Twenty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a local calendar event THEN the system SHALL open an edit form with current event details
2. WHEN a user modifies event details and saves THEN the system SHALL update the local calendar event
3. WHEN a user clicks delete on a local calendar event THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
4. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the local calendar event from the database
5. WHEN a user attempts to edit/delete an external calendar event THEN the system SHALL NOT allow these actions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want local calendar events to appear identical to external calendar events, so that I have a consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays calendar events THEN local and external events SHALL have identical visual appearance
2. WHEN the system sorts calendar events THEN local and external events SHALL be sorted together by date/time
3. WHEN a user views event details THEN local events SHALL display the same information fields as external events
4. WHEN the system loads calendar data THEN local and external events SHALL be merged seamlessly
5. WHEN a user interacts with events THEN only local events SHALL show edit/delete actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want local calendar events to respect the same permission system as other Twenty objects, so that access control is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user lacks create permissions THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "Add Event" button
2. WHEN a user creates a local calendar event THEN the system SHALL set them as the creator
3. WHEN a user attempts to edit a local calendar event THEN the system SHALL verify they are the creator
4. WHEN a user attempts to delete a local calendar event THEN the system SHALL verify they have appropriate permissions
5. WHEN the system processes calendar operations THEN it SHALL apply workspace-level permission rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want local calendar events to be stored separately from external calendar events, so that the existing calendar sync functionality remains unaffected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system creates local calendar events THEN it SHALL use a separate LocalCalendarEvent entity
2. WHEN the calendar sync process runs THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with local calendar events
3. WHEN local calendar events are created THEN they SHALL NOT conflict with external calendar event IDs
4. WHEN the system queries calendar data THEN it SHALL merge local and external events at the presentation layer
5. WHEN database migrations occur THEN existing calendar sync functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to associate local calendar events with specific People or Companies, so that I can track relationship-specific activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a calendar event from a Person record THEN the system SHALL associate the event with that Person
2. WHEN a user creates a calendar event from a Company record THEN the system SHALL associate the event with that Company
3. WHEN a user views a Person's calendar THEN the system SHALL display events associated with that Person
4. WHEN a user views a Company's calendar THEN the system SHALL display events associated with that Company
5. WHEN a Person or Company is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle associated calendar events according to cascade rules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to specify event details like title, description, location, and timing, so that I can create comprehensive calendar entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a calendar event THEN the system SHALL allow input of title, description, start time, end time, and location
2. WHEN a user sets an event as all-day THEN the system SHALL handle timing appropriately
3. WHEN a user cancels an event THEN the system SHALL mark it as canceled without deletion
4. WHEN a user saves an event with invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
5. WHEN a user views event details THEN the system SHALL display all entered information clearly
